                 <h1>What is Programming?</h1>
                 <p>In this blogging post,we will be introduced the term "programming" and understand its importance and many other related terms. We will try to cover today's blogging in fastest and easiest way.</p>
                 In simple words,"programming" is a written language.It instructs the computer to perform several tasks.
                 Officially, the first programming language for a computer was Plankalkül, developed by "Konrad Zuse"for the Z3 between 1943 and 1945.
                 <br><br>In General "programming" is a process which follows set of instructions to perform various tasks.It accomplishes tasks like:
                 
                 <li>Analysis</li>
                  <li>Testing</li>
                  <li>Debugging</li>
                  <li>Source Code Maintenance</li>
                  <li>Implementation of Build Systems</li>
                  Now lets look out what World's top richest personality Bill Gates has to say about "programming".

                   <p>“DNA is like a computer program but far, far more advanced than any software ever created.”</p><br>
                   Woah ,sounds interesting! Actually Mr Gates is absolutely correct! Indeed DNA is way more advanced and complex program than software!<br><br>

                    We have gone through the definitions & types of programming Languages.Now we will take a closer look at how does programming work & the importance of  learning Programming.
                           As we know that programming is a set of instructions to perform several tasks. Now we will demonstrate how does Programming work in fastest & simplest way.

                         <h1>How does programming work?</h1>
                         So lets understand it using python.Python is one of the easiest programming languages to understand. It is also simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability. However,we will discuss about Python in my later blog. <br>
                         we will write a simple Python program to display Hello World on the screen. This is one of the most basic program, which we usually try when start learning a programming language.<br>
                         <p>Python script to print Hello World on screen:</p>
                         Printing a message on screen is very simple in Python programming.In Python anyone can print a message on screen with a single line of code (print statement).
                         <h5> Output: Hello world</h5>

                          <h1> Why Importance of learning Programming skill is important?</h1>
                          Programming is important in our daily life to enhance and increase the power of computers and the internet.Simultaneously Programming is important to create software and applications.
                          <li>Enhanced problem solving skills</li>
                           <li>Improving problem solving & logical thinking skills</li>
                          <li>Improving communication & collaboration skills</li>
                          <li>Understanding how a software works</li>
                          <li>Career opportunity</li>
                          As we can see that programming plays a vital role in our modern technological era.By practicing programming on a daily basis one can easily  sharpen his memory & increase his creativity.Everyone should practice programming for minimum 2 hrs on a daily basis.So are you all ready to get started with programming?If you think  i have missed any of the main ideas, do not forget to mention  in the comment section below.
